The automobile industry is one of the Biggest Industries byRevenue around the globe. In the USA Automobile Industry is one of the highlylucrative industry and valued at an estimated $2 trillion. 2020 was a ratherbad year for all the industries, let alone the automobile industry where it was down approximately 18% globally. The USA was the second-largest globalproducers of Automobiles after China and surpassing India in 2020. Having thehighest registered sales in the year 2020.

And during the year of humanity worst nightmares of the 21st century,‘Tesla' became one of the most valued automobile manufacturers. So, I did a financialanalysis based on financial statements and market share to calculate the Financialratios to Compare, US-based 3 manufacturing companies namely Tesla, GeneralMotors and Ford Motors. Tesla is one the largest publicly traded carmanufacturers by market capitalisation as of 15, May 2021; trailed by GeneralMotors and Ford Motor Company. On the other hand, Ford and General Motor areranked 4th & 6th respectively as the largest motor vehicle manufacturers byrevenue.

The Analysis is based on the ratios and margins calculatedusing the 3 financial statements, Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash FlowStatement. Then the ratios were divided into the following Categoricalanalysis:
- Earning Analysis
- Margin Analysis
- Profitability Analysis 
- Market Analysis 
- Sales Analysis
- Stock Analysis

From the Visualization few things can be observed clearly, firstlyout of the three Tesla is the only companies since 2018 has grown inEarnings. Secondly, the Stock price value cannot be compared based on the company's intrinsic valuation, making its stock price highly volatile.
