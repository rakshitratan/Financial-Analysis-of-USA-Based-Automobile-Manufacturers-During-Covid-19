Automobile industry is one of the Biggest Industries by Revenue around the globe. In USA Automobile Industry is one of the highly lucrative industry and valued at an estimated $2 trillion. 2020 was a rather bad year for all the industries let alone the automobile industry where globally it was down approximately 18%. USA was the second largest global producers of Automobiles after China and surpassing India in 2020. Having the highest registered sales in the year of 2020.

And during the year of humanity worst nightmares of 21st century, â€˜Tesla' became one of the most valued automobile manufacturers. So, I did a financial analysis based on Financial statements and market share to calculate the Financial ratios to Compare, US based 3 manufacturing companies namely Tesla, General Motors and Ford Motors. Tesla is on the largest publicly traded car manufacturers by market capitalisation as of 15, May 2021; trailed by General Motors and Ford Motor Company. On the other hand, Ford and General Motor are ranked 4th & 6th respectively as the largest motor vehicle manufacturers by revenue.
The Analysis is based on the ratios and margins calculated using the 3 financial statements, Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement. Then the ratios where divide into the following Categorical analysis:
- Earning Analysis
- Margin Analysis
- Profitability Analysis
- Market Analysis
- Sales Analysis
- Stock Analysis

From the Visualization few things can be observed clearly, firstly out of the three Tesla is the only companies since 2018 having growth in Earnings. Secondly the Stock price value cannot be compared based on the Intrinsic valuation of the company, making its stock price highly volatile.
